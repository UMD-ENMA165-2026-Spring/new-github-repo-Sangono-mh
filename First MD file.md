# Making this repo
## Step 1 - What I Did
For this repo, I chose to have the **README** file as well as a license just for formality's sake. In a real project, it would be important for me to make sure the **README** is well-made as a landing page for anyone who needs to understand the repo.

I didn't add a .gitignore because it would be unnecessary for this repo, since the goal is to show being able to use a repo. The *MIT license*, from what I observed and understood, is a good license for any creator who is trying to share their software or files.
It has limitations, but on a small scale like this, it's ok.

Some other markdown that may be used.
